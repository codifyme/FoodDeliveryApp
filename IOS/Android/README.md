# FoodDeliveryApp
Food Delivery App using React Native UI for ios and Android
FIND DELIVERY APP
==================

## Description

This App allows users to find Food Delivery & Takeout from restaurant in a "X" random area, It provides information about the type of food in different categories from the best rate restaurant in the X location. The App uses Expo-CLI(native platforms) that help develop, build, deploy and quicly iteraye on iOS(Simulator), Android(Emulator) and web apps the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase. Also, Node JS/React Native Router Dom, Redux, and React Navigation(bottom-tabs). For the layout of the Mobile App I used pure React-Native Navigation to implement master components that make it easy and simple to navigate in the most convenient way.
